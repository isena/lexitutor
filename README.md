## TODO

- [ ] Integrate with ChatGPT to create content dynamically
- [ ] Create an 'about' section explaining how the content is created
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Re-structure the quiz creation - make it more random and think about different modes and customizations
- [ ] Check best practices of React apps (perhaps move all css related settings to specific files)
- [ ] UI improvements - that's for sure :)
